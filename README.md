# Catalogue
A REST client website I made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. When the page is opened in the browser it accesses the REST API of a fictitious sports company, receives the response as a JSON file, and renders the content in the webpage so the user can browse the company's products.

### User Experience
The user can browse a gallery of products sold by the fictitious company hPlusSport.
The gallery shows a title and thumbnail image for each item. When the user clicks on a product it is presented in the left frame with a larger image, description and price.

### Concepts

A REST client that creates an XHR request that sends a GET request to a REST API.

A JSON text file is received and parsed into a javascript collection.

Javascript DOM utilities transfer data from a javascript collection to the HTML document.

Element nodes are called, copied and inserted into the DOM.

Presentation is controlled using CSS tools such as grid, flexbox, transform, transition.
